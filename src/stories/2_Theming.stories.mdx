# Theming

By default, the library ships with a default `Theme` object that can be provided to the `theme` prop of the
`<ThemeProviderInjector>` component that is placed on the root of your project.

The object follows this structure:

```javascript
const Theme = {
    space: {
        xxs,
        xs,
        sm,
        default,
        md,
        lg,
        xlg,
        xxlg,
    },
    colors: {
        background,
        textPrimary,
        textBody,

        primary,
        primaryShade,
        primaryTint,
        primaryContrast,

        secondary,
        secondaryShade,
        secondaryTint,
        secondaryContrast,

        tertiary,
        tertiaryShade,
        tertiaryTint,
        tertiaryContrast,

        danger,
        dangerTint,
        success,
        successShade,
        pending,

        gray,
        grayShade,
        grayTint,
        lightGray,

        white,
    },
    boxShadow: {
        default,
    },
    border: {
        default,
        hover,
        danger,
        success,
        light,
    },
    fontFaces: {
        primary,
        secondary
    },
}
```

You can customize this theme by creating your own theme file with this structure and providing the correspondent values
to each property.

You can then use this file on the `theme` prop for the `ThemeProviderInjector`:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { ThemeProvider } from "@8sistemas/design-system";
import { MyCustomTheme } from "./MyCustomTheme";

ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <ThemeProviderInjector theme={MyCustomTheme}>
            <App />
        </ThemeProviderInjector>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

> **Important**: As of now, there is no support for modular theme extensions, and changing the default property names
> directly on the provided theme will break existing styles on the library's components. A rebuilt ThemeProvider with
> support for theme extensions is planned for the v1.0 release.
