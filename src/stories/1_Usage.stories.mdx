# Installing

To install the component library, run:

```bash
yarn add @8sistemas/design-system
```

# Setting up the ThemeProvider

For this library to work correctly you need to set up the `ThemeProviderInjector` at the root of your application.

Inject the `ThemeProviderInjector` in the project root. By default, the `ThemeProviderInjector` uses the default `Theme`
object included in the package. If you wish, you can specify your custom theme to match the project's needs (see more
about theming and customization [here]()).

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { Theme, ThemeProvider } from "@8sistemas/design-system";

ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <ThemeProviderInjector theme={Theme}>
            <App />
        </ThemeProviderInjector>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Use the components in any place of the project that is in the scope of `ThemeProviderInjector` and the project root. Use
this documentation as reference for the components, props, and API's available.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "@8sistemas/design-system";

const Example = () => <Button color="primary">Hello World</Button>;
```
