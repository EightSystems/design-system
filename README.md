This Design System is used in the building of internal products at @EightSystems. It is built with Storybook, React and Sass.

As this is an internal design system, we don't accept suggestions to change or add new components.

## ‚ö† Important Note

> This project is using a purposefully older version of Storybook (v5.3 from January 2020), given that recent changes to Storybook on v6 ‚Äî along with poor documentation on Sass integration ‚Äî creates a roadblock on development. Migration to updated versions will be considered once Sass integration on Storybook regains stability.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

Clone the repository and run the following:

```jsx
yarn install
```

Once the project dependencies finish installing, you can navigate to the directory and start the Storybook preview with:

```jsx
yarn storybook
```

Open [`http://localhost:6006/`](http://localhost:6006/) (it should open automatically) to see the Storybook interface with the component library.

# üßê What's inside?

The project is configured with a set of addons to automatize the internal documentation process:

- `@storybook/addon-actions` - Used to display data received by event handlers in the stories preview.
- `@storybook/addon-a11y`- Used to run essential accessibility audits for components on the fly.
- `storybook-addon-react-docgen` - Used to create automatic documentation based on the props defined in the component's code.
