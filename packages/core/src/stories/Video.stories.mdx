# Streaming Video Player

The Streaming Video Player (called `WebVideo`) uses [Plyr](https://plyr.io/) under the hood, with the popular
[plyr-react](https://github.com/chintan9/plyr-react) package to render the video component.

That way you have all the power of Plyr, including YouTube, Vimeo, and HTML5 video support using one single API.

It also configures Plyr CSS to use your configured theme, so the fonts will match with your typography, same applies for
colors.

## Native Support

In order to make it work the same way in the native side, we wrap the player in a `WebView`, so that way we have the
same player on every platform. Even though there are other player components on the market, most of the them rely on
some sort of WebView approach, for example, the Youtube player on iOS relies on WebView, and on Android relies on the
YouTube application being installed in the user device, this might not be acceptable, as a user might have a device
without any `GApps` installed.

## Import

```jsx
import { WebVideo } from "@8sistemas/design-system";
```

## Example

Sadly this component can't render directly in Storybook as it needs to manipulate some of the DOM, and Storybook doesn't
like it, but you can use the following code as a sample for the component usage:

```jsx
<WebVideo
    options={{
        controls: [
            "rewind",
            "play",
            "play-large",
            "fast-forward",
            "progress",
            "current-time",
            "duration",
            "mute",
            "volume",
            "settings",
            "fullscreen",
        ],
    }}
    source={{
        poster: "https://cdn.plyr.io/static/demo/View_From_A_Blue_Moon_Trailer-HD.jpg",
        sources: [
            {
                provider: "html5",
                size: 576,
                src: "https://cdn.plyr.io/static/demo/View_From_A_Blue_Moon_Trailer-576p.mp4",
                type: "video/mp4",
            },
            {
                provider: "html5",
                size: 720,
                src: "https://cdn.plyr.io/static/demo/View_From_A_Blue_Moon_Trailer-720p.mp4",
                type: "video/mp4",
            },
        ],
        type: "video",
    }}
/>
```

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Sample Video inside a Modal">
        {args => {
            return <WebVideoModalSample />;
        }}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
