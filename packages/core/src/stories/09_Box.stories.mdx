# Box

A replacement to `div` on Web and `View` on Native. You should be using this component instead of divs and Views, as it
will allow your code to be platform agnostic. That way you can simply do:

```jsx
const MyContainerComponent = styled(Box)`
    padding-left: 100px;
`;
```

And it will work on **both** the platforms

## Import

```jsx
import { Box } from "@8sistemas/design-system";
```

## Example

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Box" args={{ backgroundColor: "dangerGradient", padding: "xs" }}>
        {args => {
            return (
                <Box {...args}>
                    <Text>My text inside the xs padded box</Text>
                </Box>
            );
        }}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

# Shadow Support

We do some Platform specific tests to know which property we need to apply, on web we just use `box-shadow`, on native,
Android only has support for `elevation`, and iOS has support for all others.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Box" args={{ backgroundColor: "light", padding: "xs", shadowSize: "sm" }}>
        {args => {
            return (
                <Box {...args}>
                    <Text>This is a sm shadow box</Text>
                </Box>
            );
        }}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Box} />
