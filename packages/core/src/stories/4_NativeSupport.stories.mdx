# Native Support

The whole point of building this design-system was to be able to use the same components over the `Web` and `Native`
sides, trying to make them work with the same props, and styles in both platforms.

But, as we all know, react-native has some particularities, for example, the `font-weight` and `font-face` properties
doesn't support fonts with multiple `weight` symbols. So, in react-native you need to add multiple fonts for multiple
weights.

For example, we use `Poppins` as `primary`, and `Inter` as our `secondary` font styles, and as you can see in the `docs`
app, we have to use multiple font-files to make them work in the native side:

![Docs Fonts Folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EightSystems/design-system/master/.github/assets/docs-fonts-folder.png)

We tried our best to make it as transparent as possible, with some code in the styles mixins to make it work using the
same props you would use in the `web` side.

For example, there are two ways you can make a `Text` bold in the native side:

```jsx
<Text fontFace={"primaryBold"}>Bold Text Here</Text>
```

OR

```jsx
<Text fontWeight={"bold"}>Bold Text Here</Text>
```

Both of them will render the same font, `primaryBold`, with the later using auto-discovery from the `fontWeight` mixin.
