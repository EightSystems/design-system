# Native Support

The whole point of building this design-system was to be able to use the same components over the `Web` and `Native` sides, trying to make them work with the same props, and styles in both platforms.

But, as we all know, react-native has some particularities, for example, the `font-weight` and `font-face` properties doesn't support fonts with multiple `weight` symbols.
So, in react-native you need to add multiple fonts for multiple weights.

For example, we use `Poppins` as `primary`, and `Inter` as our `secondary` font styles, and as you can see in the `docs` app, we have to use multiple font-files to make them work in the native side:

We tried our best to make it as transparent as possible, with some code in the styles mixins to make it work using the same props you would use in the `web` side.

For example, there are two ways you can make a `Text` bold in the native side:

```jsx
<Text fontFace={'primaryBold'}>
    Bold Text Here
</Text>
```

OR

```jsx
<Text fontWeight={'bold'}>
    Bold Text Here
</Text>
```

Both of them will render the same font, `primaryBold`, with the later using auto-discovery from the `fontWeight` mixin.
