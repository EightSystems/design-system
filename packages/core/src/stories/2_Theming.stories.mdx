# Theming

By default, the library ships with a default `Theme` object that can be provided to the `theme` prop of the
`<ThemeProviderInjector>` component that is placed on the top level component of your project.

The object has two "distinct" structures, one for web, and one for native, the major difference being the typography font faces, and shadow settings.

#### Web defaults and theme format:

<CodeSyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" codeString={`const Theme = ${JSON.stringify(theme, null, 2)}`}/>

#### Native defaults and theme format:

<CodeSyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" codeString={`const Theme = ${JSON.stringify(nativeTheme, null, 2)}`}/>

## Theme Customization

You can customize this theme by creating your own theme object with this structure and providing the correspondent values
to each property, with the support of deep-merge, we dont't need the whole theme object, and you can just update the properties you need.

You can then use this object at the `theme` prop for the `ThemeProviderInjector`:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { ThemeProviderInjector } from "@8sistemas/design-system";

const MyCustomTheme = {
    colors: {
        primary: 'red'
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <ThemeProviderInjector theme={MyCustomTheme}>
            <App />
        </ThemeProviderInjector>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```
