# Theming

By default, the library ships with a default `Theme` object that can be provided to the `theme` prop of the
`<ThemeProviderInjector>` component that is placed on the root of your project.

The object has two "distinct" structures, one for web, and one for native, the major difference being the typography font faces, and shadow settings.

#### Web defaults and theme format:

<CodeSyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" codeString={`const Theme = ${JSON.stringify(theme, null, 2)}`}/>

#### Native defaults and theme format:

<CodeSyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" codeString={`const Theme = ${JSON.stringify(nativeTheme, null, 2)}`}/>

## Theme Customization

You can customize this theme by creating your own theme file with this structure and providing the correspondent values
to each property.

You can then use this file on the `theme` prop for the `ThemeProviderInjector`:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { ThemeProvider } from "@8sistemas/design-system";
import { MyCustomTheme } from "./MyCustomTheme";

ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <ThemeProviderInjector theme={MyCustomTheme}>
            <App />
        </ThemeProviderInjector>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

> **Important**: As of now, there is no support for modular theme extensions, and changing the default property names
> directly on the provided theme will break existing styles on the library's components. A rebuilt ThemeProvider with
> support for theme extensions is planned for the v1.0 release.
