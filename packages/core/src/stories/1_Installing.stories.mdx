# Installing

1. To install the component library, run:

```bash
yarn add @8sistemas/design-system
```

2. Inject the `ThemeProvider` in the project root. By default, the `ThemeProvider` uses the default `Theme` object
   included in the package. If you wish, you can specify your custom theme to match the project's needs (see more about
   theming and customization in the `Theming` section).

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { Theme, ThemeProvider } from "@8sistemas/design-system";

ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <ThemeProviderInjector theme={Theme}>
            <App />
        </ThemeProviderInjector>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

3. Import the fonts specified on the `fontFaces` object of the `Theme` in the way that makes the most sense for your
   project. These are the font imported for the default `Theme` object:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Poppins:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap"
    rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

4. Use the components in any place of the project that is in the scope of `ThemeProvider` and the project root. Use the
   Storybook generated documentation as reference for the components, props, and API's available.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "@8sistemas/design-system";

const Example = () => <Button color="primary">Hello World</Button>;
```

# Peer Dependencies

In order to support both "Web" and "Native" platforms with the same package, most of our dependencies need to be
installed in the project, that way our bundle size is small and you can choose to install only what you really need.

Here is the list of the peerDependencies:

<CodeSyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" codeString={`${JSON.stringify(packageJson.peerDependencies, null, 2)}`} />

## Styled-Components

**WARNING:** Even though Styled-Components is marked as a Peer-Dependency, it is strictly required for this package.
Sadly, we can't require it directly from our package as Styled-Components has issues when being bundled with two
different versions.

## React-dom

**Only** required when building a Web app.

## React

Required by any project that it's either React, or React-Native, not much you need to here.
