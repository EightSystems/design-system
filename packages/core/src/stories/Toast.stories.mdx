# Toast

Toast can be used to display alerts in the upper layer. This component can be used to provide feedback to a user after
some action is done.

> **Warning**: Storybook doesn't contain the `Toast` inside the canvas, so you will always see it outside of the
> `MDX Canvas`. That being said, please use the `Canvas` tab in order to play with the component.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Toast"
        args={{
            title: "Neutral Action",
            description: "A neutral action was executed",
            status: "info",
            position: "bottom-right",
            showToast: true,
            onClose: action("onClose"),
        }}
    >
        {args => <Toast {...args} />}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Import
