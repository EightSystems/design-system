# Skeleton

The Skeleton is used to demonstrate a loading state, simulating the component's skeleton.

## Variantes

The Skeleton can be rendered as a retangular shape by declaring only the `size` prop, that will determinate the component height, (component width will be determinated by the container's dimensions). Aditionally, the `borderRadius` prop can be used to round the component's borders.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Skeleton Regular" args={{ borderRadius: 2, size: 30 }}>
        {args => <Skeleton {...args} />}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

The Skeleton can also be rendered as a circular shape by using the props `size` and `isCircular`. In that case, the prop `borderRadius` is ignored.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Skeleton Circular" args={{ isCircular: true, size: 80 }}>
        {args => <Skeleton {...args} />}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
